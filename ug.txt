Wooooo!! Finally entered an Engineering College. It is one of he top 10 colleges of my state. Wonderful campus and 
competitive ancestors (I mean it's filled with monkeys). It was very novel and remembarable experience of my life.
Many academic and life learnings. Interactions with amazing faculty who made huge impact on my life. 
Few of them enabled me to think in a better way.
Few stood as an example on how to lead a life while 
few of them taught how not to do it.
